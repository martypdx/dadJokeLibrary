# Dad Joke Library

## Overview
A simplistic router-based joke game. Fun for the whole family, except mostly just for dad.

## Description
Dadjoke is a simple game for people who appreciate jokes and enjoy mad-lib or fill-in-the-blank style games.  It's played in rounds.  The player is issued a prompt and can fill in their own answer.  Answers from each player are submitted and then players are allowed to vote (with emojis) on their favorites.  The results are tallied and returned to show the top voted answers.

##Credit goes to:
This is an original idea inspired by groan worthy dad jokesters everywhere.  We'd like to give thanks to our own dads for their quirks and eccentricities, which helped to shape us into humans who love a good dad joke.  We'd also like to credit our mothers for loving them anyway.
